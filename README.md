# st - simple terminal

Forked from [https://github.com/shiva/st](https://github.com/shiva/st) for simplicity's sake, which is the suckless terminal (st) with some patches added:

+ copy to clipboard
+ solarized colors (light and dark toggleable)
+ vertcenter
+ scrollback with keyboard
+ scrollback with mouse

## My additions

Right now, I've just made the default font the system "mono" at size 14, and I've remapped the key to toggle the light/dark color scheme to Alt-Tab. It originally was F6, which is too often mapped by some other program.

## Terminal-specific mappings

+ Scroll through history -- Shift+PageUp/PageDown or Shift+Mouse wheel
+ Toggle light/dark mode -- Alt+Tab
+ Increase/decrease font size -- Shift+Alt+PageUp/PageDown
+ Return to default dont size -- Shift+Alt+Home
+ Paste -- Shift+Insert
